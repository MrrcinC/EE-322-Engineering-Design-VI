# Lab 8
## Data Analysis

I have provided below some snapshots of my experimentation with some data analysis capabilities that python can deliver, through use of histograms, charts including time series, and a scatter plot with a linear trednline, based on the CPU data we gathered from the previous lab (lab 7).

## Edit plt_final.py and plt_cv2.py to read CSV file with customized plot titles

plt_final.py
> data = read_csv('rpidata.csv')

plt_cv2.py
> X = read_csv('rpidata.csv', usecols=[1])
> Y = read_csv('rpidata.csv', usecols=[2])

## Python plt_final
